# 3DRubiksCube
A 3 dimensional Rubiks Cube

This project was fun for me, as I really got into depth with JavaFX, however like everything there is still much to learn.
There is limited functionality to this 3DRubiks Cube, and so only 3 sides can rotate at a time.

Watch this youtube video for a full demonstration of the cube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WL8501BWt8
